# Object Oriented Design

This repository is focused on analyzing the design of a few applications as well as some popular ones. 

This will help for the future of our SWE journey.

The object-oriented design has always been a critical part of the software engineering interview process. Most of the engineers struggle with the object-oriented design interviews (OODI) mainly because of the open-ended nature of the design problems that donâ€™t have a standard answer.

This is a complete guide to master the OODI. It not only has a set of carefully handpicked case studies, which have been repeatedly asked at the top tech companies but also provides a thorough experience to handle different object-oriented design scenarios.

In this repository, we be working on the following design problems:
